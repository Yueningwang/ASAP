**Solar PV Siting Survey for Anchorage, Alaska**

Project Sponsor: Erin Whitney (Alaska Center for Energy and Power)

Project Team: Jingtian Zhang (Chemical Engineering), Cheng Zeng (Materials Science and Engineering), Yuening Wang (Chemical Engineering)

This project will identify potential solar sites to install solar panels on roofs and parking lots/ structures in Anchorage. Solar energy calculation model will be built based on packages in Arcgis Desktop, including slope, aspect and solar radiation. The input should be Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data, and the output will be potential solar energy calculated by the model. Also, this project takes omission of HVAC system, vents and pipes on the rooftop, parking lots on the ground into consideration, making solar calculation more accurate. Eventually, this model might apply to other cities with similar situation.
