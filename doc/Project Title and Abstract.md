**Solar PV Siting Survey for Anchorage, Alaska**

Project Sponsor: Erin Whitney (Alaska Center for Energy and Power)

Project Team: Jingtian Zhang (Chemical Engineering), Cheng Zeng (Materials Science and Engineering), Yuening Wang (Chemical Engineering)

This project will identify potential solar sites to install solar panels on roofs and parking lots/ structures in Anchorage. Solar energy calculation model will be built based on packages in Arcgis Desktop, including, slope, aspect and solar radiation. The input should be Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data, and the output will be potential solar energy calculated by the model. This project, unlike other common PV esimation projects, requires omission of HVAC system, vents and pipes on the rooftop, and it accounts for the parking lots on the surface in the solar potential estimation. Eventually, all of results will be summarized in a csv spreadsheet and shown in kml file on google earth pro. Also, the model used in this project should also be used in other similar circumstances.
