The purpose of this file is to go through concepts and details of packages used in the model building process.

Packages will be used:
1. Create LAS Dataset (Data Management)
2. from LAS Dataset to Raster
3. Classify LAS Buildings (unnecessary if the filter option of las dataset already includes check boxes of buildings
and last return)
4. Slope
5. Aspect
6. Hillshade
7. Extract by Mask
8. Raster Calculator
9. Clip
10. Solar Irradiation Analyst
11. Raster to Points
12. Aggregate Points
13. Zonal Statistics 

Details in some significant packages
1. Aspect
Input: DEM

Methods and Approach:
The aspect should be south facing or horizontal, because Anchorage is located in the northern hemisphere, solar panels
located on south-facing slopes will have a higher solar power output than those located on north-facing slopes. So we
choose Flat, 112.5 <= aspect <= 247.5, set value to 1, others to None

Output: Aspect Raster

2. Slope
Input:DEM

Methods and Approach:
The slope should be less than 35 degrees. In this angel, it will be easy to install solar panels. So with slope degree
<= 35 to 1, others to None

Output: Slope Raster

3. Solar Irradiation Analyst
Input: Aspect and Slope Raster

Methods and Approach:
We use the solar radiation tool in Arcgis to calculate solar radiation, which use hemispherical viewshed algorithm.

Output: Solar radiation Raster
