The purpose of this file is to go through concepts and details of packages used in the model building process.

### Packages will be used:
1. Create LAS Dataset (Data Management)
2. from LAS Dataset to Rasters
3. Classify LAS Buildings (unnecessary if the filter option of las dataset already includes check boxes of buildings and last return)
4. Slope
5. Aspect
6. Hillshade
7. Extract by Mask
8. Raster Calculator
9. Clip
10. Solar Irradiation Analyst
11. Raster to Points
12. Aggregate Points
13. Zonal Statistics 

### Details in some significant pakages 
1. Aspect
Input: 
DEM or other rasters
Definition: 
Aspect tool is used to calculate the direction of surface, and the given result will be shown in degrees and labels 
(EAST, WEST, SOUTH, NORTH, and etc.) depending on how many categories the user classifies them. According to Esri Arcgis website, 

     "Aspect identifies the downslope direction of the maximum rate of change in value from each cell to its neighbors. 
      Aspect can be thought of as the slope direction. The values of the output raster will be the compass direction of the aspect."
