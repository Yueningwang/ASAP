Solar PV Siting Survey for Anchorage, Alaska

The project will determine the technical siting potential for commercial-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) installations of 1,000 kW (AC) or larger throughout Anchorage, within the built environment. The methodology can build upon the Clean Coalitionâ€™s work conducting similar Solar Siting Surveys for other entities. The project will identify lower cost and higher value renewable resource opportunities reflecting characteristics of all available sites in relation to existing loads and electric grid infrastructure. Outcomes will guide the development of cost-effective local solar generation within Anchorage.

## Provided Materials
1. EBCE case study (.kml)
2. EBCE project summary (.xlsx)
3. LIDAR data collected in 2015 (.las)
4. Municipality of Anchorage boundary (.shp)
5. CAMA Household Property Information (.xlsx)
6. Buildings (.gdb)
7. Arcgis license offered by instructor

## Procedures
1. Select an area for case study 
2. Rasterize the region and obtain information via different tools on ArcMap


## Study CaseS
The study case is selected as one area where buildings, some parking lots and empty grounds exist in a well sorted pattern. The selected las file name is 1659_2614.las. LAS file contains raw LIDAR point cloud data including x, y and z values. By creating a new "LAS Dataset" it is possible to load the data into Arcmap


## Tips
1. This program is based on LIDAR data and corresponding building polygons extraction 
2. Python script generated by the model can process similar situations elsewhere
3. Assumptions are listed in the section "Assumptions" below
4. Due to limited access to ICA data, which can only be provided by local electricity company, ICA summary is abandoned
