Solar PV Siting Survey for Anchorage, Alaska

The project will determine the technical siting potential for commercial-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) installations of 1,000 kW (AC) or larger throughout Anchorage, within the built environment. The methodology can build upon the Clean Coalitionâ€™s work conducting similar Solar Siting Surveys for other entities. The project will identify lower cost and higher value renewable resource opportunities reflecting characteristics of all available sites in relation to existing loads and electric grid infrastructure. Outcomes will guide the development of cost-effective local solar generation within Anchorage.
